    "**search_documents(query)** — full-text search over indexed documents. "

    "**execute_python(code)** — runs Python in a subprocess and returns stdout. "

    "- For document questions: call search_documents first, then answer from results.\n"
    "- Never guess file contents or paths — use tools to check.\n"
    "- Be concise. Cite sources from search results.\n"
    "- Do not use emojis in responses."
